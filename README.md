## Project vision :see_no_evil:

During this session we wish to share, explore, and develop ideas for enabling our ethical safari company, ```Maisha``` to contribute to open science and data projects.

```Maisha``` is a very young ethical safari company. Our aim is to place more power in the hands of local people in Kenya, so that they see more of the proceeds of tourism. We deliver low-cost safaris, tailored specifically for each customer, using a modular, online booking system. We believe that tourism should enable a rich, cultural exchange; and the experiences that we offer maximise this, and strip out exploitation of both local guides, and of tourists - so everyone gets a great deal!
